- title: Zoom meeting
  topic: Focus on the consensus variant interpretation guideline, reviewing the QV flag set used across clinical, research, and commercial workflows. Examples include population frequency checks, inheritance logic, protein feature mapping, phenotype matching, transcript relevance, splicing support, read-level quality, and conflict detection. The aim is to agree a shared, minimal evidence rule set that all pipelines can reuse.

  topic: Draft SGA guidelines for variant interpretation and genomic decision infrastructure, including the full QV specification, clinical bioinformatics recommendations, GA4GH aligned evidence structures, a three pillar architecture, and practical examples of how these standards can be applied.

- title: Zoom meeting
  topic: How Switzerland can adopt shared national standards for genomics, with an introduction to treating variant interpretation as a data science and reproducibility problem rather than a purely manual clinical genetics task.
