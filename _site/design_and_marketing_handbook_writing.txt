## Swiss Genomics Association – Comprehensive Writing Philosophy

### Core Principles

* Clarity is authority. Simplicity is not style alone; it demonstrates rigorous thinking.
* Truth before style. Insight beats adjectives. Avoid selling; reveal the system.
* The user or reader is the hero. Write for intelligent, sceptical people who respect evidence and logic.
* Precision over performance. Good writing persuades through clarity and structure, not flair.
* Structure reveals thinking. Show how parts connect: cause and consequence, observation and insight, architecture and outcome.
* Consequence trumps capability. The result for the user or the field matters more than features or technical terms.

### Scientific Writing Principles (e.g. for Nature Genetics)

* Use clear, precise, succinct language.
* Avoid generic phrasing or vague summaries.
* Maintain a professional, academic tone without hype or promotional language.
* Prefer sentence-based exposition over lists, unless a list truly clarifies complex ideas.
* Avoid rhetorical questions.
* Never use em-dashes; choose commas, semicolons, or separate sentences.
* Keep paragraphs concise, typically three to five sentences.
* Maintain British spelling.
* Cite references inline when provided, preserving citation details unless instructed otherwise.
* Prioritise clarity, logical flow, and evidence-based reasoning.
* Avoid filler phrases such as “It is important to note that…” or “It should be highlighted that…”.
* Do not use superlatives like “ground-breaking” or “revolutionary” unless substantiated by evidence.
* Ensure comparisons and claims are cautious and evidence-based.
* Write with persuasive precision, aiming to inform and convince expert readers.
* Vary sentence structures; avoid repetition of phrases like “Importantly,” or “Notably,” at sentence beginnings.
* Preserve technical detail, but explain it succinctly and accessibly.
* Keep titles and section headings in sentence case.
* When summarising, synthesise rather than simply listing facts.
* Prefer direct statements over hedging, unless genuine uncertainty exists.

### General Writing Style for All Contexts

* One core idea per piece. The reader should be able to summarise it in one sentence.

* Avoid puffery and clichés:

  * “game-changing”
  * “revolutionary”
  * “unlocking the power of…”
  * “seamless”
  * “at the intersection of X and Y”
  * “empowering clinicians”
  * “designed with you in mind”
  * “built for the future”
  * “in today’s world…”

* Replace hype with consequences:

  > Instead of “delivering revolutionary insights,” write “quantifying the probability of genetic disease, even when no variant is observed.”

* Avoid long introductory flourishes. Begin with a direct statement of problem, insight, or result.

* Use precise words: “probability,” “evidence,” “uncertainty,” “coverage,” “diagnostic yield.”

* Be transparent about limitations, data gaps, or remaining uncertainties. This earns trust.

* Keep sentences short where possible. Split complex thoughts into separate sentences for clarity.

* Let your writing leave room for the reader’s conclusion. Don’t tie every piece with a marketing bow.

* Avoid adjectives unless they are provable or meaningful.

### Structure Patterns

* **The Reveal**

  > “Everyone looks at observed variants. Few measure what’s missing. We do both.”

* **The Bridge**

  > “Genetic testing typically stops at what’s seen. Missing variants matter. We quantify them so clinicians can act on a complete picture.”

* **The Mirror**

  > “Historians measure silence as carefully as speech. We measure unsequenced regions as rigorously as observed data.”

* **Quiet Power Statements**

  > “We quantify uncertainty. So it stops being uncertainty.”

---

### Practical Writing Prompts

* What is the single idea of this piece?
* Can a colleague repeat it back after thirty seconds?
* What problem does this solve? Why couldn’t it be solved before?
* What is the evidence or architecture behind our claim?
* Why should anyone outside our company care?
* Have I avoided clichés and filler phrases?
* Have I avoided adjectives unless strictly provable?
* Could this piece be read aloud in a quiet room and feel honest and intelligent rather than performative?

---

### Design & Visual Alignment

* Colour: restrained, monochrome plus a single accent.
* Typography: clean sans-serif, generous spacing, calm authority.
* Motion: slow fades, confident cuts, logical rather than decorative transitions.
* Layout: grid-based, with white space used as an active design element.
* Icons: abstract systems or processes, not literal metaphors.
* Visuals should illustrate:

  * System architecture
  * Data evidence
  * Consequences for users or science

---

### Mantras to Remember

* We clarify genomics. We don’t sell it.
* We reveal systems, not surface hype.
* We write for intelligent readers who demand evidence.
* We let users be the hero.
* We quantify what others ignore.
* Technically sound. Incredibly simple.

The quality of reporting expected from the **Swiss Genomics Association** is defined by precision, transparency, and scientific accountability. Reports and publications issued under its name should reflect:

1. **Evidence-based rigour**
   All statements and recommendations must be supported by verifiable data, established literature, or expert consensus drawn from peer-reviewed sources. References should be clearly cited, and interpretations should distinguish between evidence, consensus, and opinion.

2. **National representativeness**
   Outputs should integrate input from the Association’s multi-institutional membership, representing Switzerland’s academic, clinical, governmental, and industrial sectors. Reports must show that diverse perspectives have been considered and reconciled through structured discussion.

3. **Ethical and regulatory alignment**
   Publications should address ethical, legal, and societal implications where relevant, ensuring alignment with Swiss and international frameworks governing health data, clinical genomics, and public research.

4. **Clarity and neutrality**
   Text should be written in clear, accessible language, free from promotional or partisan tone. The style should match the impartial and authoritative tone expected from a national coordination body.

5. **Transparency of process**
   Each released document should indicate how the topic was prioritised, what evidence or consultations informed the outcome, and how consensus was achieved.

6. **Scientific traceability and reproducibility**
   Data sources, methodologies, and analytical reasoning should be stated in enough detail for others to assess or reproduce conclusions.

7. **Public value and accessibility**
   Reports are to be made openly available, serving health, research, and policy communities. They should contribute to collective understanding, sustainable infrastructure, and coordinated national standards.

In short, reporting under the Swiss Genomics Association is expected to meet the same editorial and ethical standards as peer-reviewed scientific work, while providing concise, credible, and nationally coordinated guidance for genomics in health and research.
