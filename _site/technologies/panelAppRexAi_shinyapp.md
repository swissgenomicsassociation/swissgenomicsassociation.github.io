PanelAppRex AI introduces a sophisticated search function in our Panel App, designed to facilitate the discovery of disease gene panels through searches for genes, phenotypes, PubMed IDs, or other relevant data. 

While our robust database underpins this tool, we are actively refining the user interface. To aid in our development, we provide open early access, allowing users to explore and utilize our evolving features.
