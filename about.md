<!-- * [About page](about_page) -->

The Swiss Genomics Association is a national collaboration of volunteer experts from leading academic, federal, and industry organisations. Together we define open, shared standards for the responsible use of genomics in human health, precision medicine, and research.

We meet every three months to review and rank proposed topics according to national importance. Our discussions bring together perspectives from across Switzerland and include coordination with international partners who hold authority in the field or who benefit from the content we develop.

Our work spans the complete landscape of genomic implementation. We address the ethical, clinical, and financial dimensions of national-scale genomics programmes, including variant interpretation standards, evaluation of new sequencing techniques, and long-term planning for sustainable infrastructure.

Each meeting involves review of relevant scientific literature, including studies produced by member institutions. Selected papers are indexed as recommended reading, forming a shared evidence base for our outputs. The core purpose of the Association is to develop and release authoritative documents such as white papers, guidelines, and review articles that support Swiss and international practice.

We exist to ensure that genomics in Switzerland remains coordinated, credible, and of public value.
