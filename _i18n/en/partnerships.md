<h1>Partnerships</h1>

We define standards. You build upon them.

The Swiss Genomics Association works with academic, clinical, federal, and industry partners to establish shared frameworks for genomics in health, research, and national implementation. Our collaborations turn evidence, policy, and practice into coherent national standards that others can rely on.

### What we offer

We do not compete with projects. We enable them through shared principles and open coordination.

We provide:
* Consensus frameworks for genomic data use, ethics, and interpretation
* National reference documents for clinical and research genomics
* Open guidelines for evidence generation, validation, and reporting
* Expert coordination between federal, academic, and clinical institutions

### How we collaborate

Our partnerships are transparent, structured, and built on mutual benefit.

**Collaborative working groups**
Joint development of white papers, policy frameworks, or national guidelines.

**Research and evidence exchange**
Contribution of scientific expertise and literature to shared reviews and reference collections.

**Strategic alignment**
Coordination with Swiss and international organisations to maintain compatibility across systems, ethics, and data governance.

### Who we work with

We collaborate with:
* Federal offices and national programmes in health and research
* Academic and university hospitals
* Research institutes and bioinformatics groups
* Industry partners developing clinical or technological infrastructure
* International networks aligned with open, evidence-based genomics

Together we ensure that genomics in Switzerland remains coordinated, credible, and of public value.
