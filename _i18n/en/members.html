The Swiss Genomics Association brings together professionals from across genomics, including data science, bioinformatics, clinical genetics, medicine, ethics, security, and patient representation. Membership is barrier free to encourage broad participation and adoption of modern best practices. Members promote nationwide collaboration in genomics, while guidelines and standards are rigorously prepared by expert authors who represent the wider membership and ensure that outputs remain scientifically robust, balanced, and nationally relevant.
