Biographical information from members was analysed to identify key areas of work and interest. Each node represents a recurring topic or skill. Colours denote topic groups, and node size reflects how common a topic is across member profiles. Larger nodes indicate more frequently discussed areas. The network reveals shared areas of focus and emerging themes that contribute to progress across the community.
