<h1>Message CEOs</h1>

Someone on your team has recommended that you connect with the Swiss Genomics Association. They did so because they recognise that shared standards and coordinated practice improve outcomes for every organisation working with genomics in Switzerland.

Genomics is becoming central to clinical care, public health, and research in Switzerland. Each organisation contributes a part of the national system, but without shared standards the system becomes inconsistent and difficult to trust. The Swiss Genomics Association provides a coordinated framework so that hospitals, laboratories, industry, and research groups work from the same evidence-based foundation.

## Why your involvement matters

Executive leadership determines how organisations adopt and apply genomics. When CEOs participate, standards reflect practical realities, operational needs, and long term national priorities. This prevents fragmented approaches, reduces duplicated effort, and creates guidance that is both credible and usable across sectors.

## Strategic value

Common standards lower uncertainty, improve interoperability, and support smoother collaboration with clinical and regulatory partners. They offer a stable reference for quality assurance and product integration. Organisations that engage early help shape requirements that they will later rely on.
